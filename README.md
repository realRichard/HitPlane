##  **Functional specification**

- [X]   we provide player two ways to attack nenmies, the normal attack only reduce one lives of enemy at a time, the big skill directly end the live of enemy.

- [X]   there are three different kinds of enemies in our game, small enemy, middle enemy, and big enemy, they appear at random at different speeds, when middle enemy and big enemy are beaten, they will performance different effects.

- [X]   we implement particle system, it applied to explode when plane was destroyed.

- [X]   we also provide development version functionality, when debug mode is true, we can change player speed, enemy speed, bullet speed, bullet coolDown, and fps(frame per second) randomly by drag the range. 

- [X]   moreover, we can pause the game or resume the game by press p in anytime, it's like cheating. hahaha.
